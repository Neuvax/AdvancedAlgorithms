# Instructions
Write a C++ program that proposes a solution to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). You can work in couples.

Given a weighted undirected graph. Find the sum of weights of edges of a Minimum Spanning Tree.

## Input:
Given 2 integers N and M. N represents the number of vertices in the graph. M represents the number of edges between any 2 vertices.
Then M lines follow, each line has 3 space separated integers (ai, bi, wi ) where ai  and  bi represents an edge from a vertex "a" to a vertex "b" and "w" represents the weight of that edge.

## Output:
Print the summation of edges weights in the MST.

### Input example:

```
4 5
1 2 7
1 4 6
4 2 9
4 3 8
2 3 6
```

### Output example:
```
19
