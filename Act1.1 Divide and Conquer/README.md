# Instructions
Using the "divide and conquer" programming technique write a program that implements the MergeSort algorithm in C++. You can work in couples.

The program receives an integer N, followed by N real or double values, one on each line, by standard input.

The output of the program is a list of the N values sorted from smallest to largest.
